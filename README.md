### Hello there! 👋 My name is Kaveh,
 
I am a dedicated software engineer with almost four years of professional experience. I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects that help uplift people, and building a thriving community of developers.

#### Due to my involvement in various projects and my eagerness to learn new skills, I have been busy and have not had the opportunity to publish much code on GitHub. However, I am striving to become more active on the platform.

💻 My areas of expertise include Python, JavaScript, and Web development with WordPress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery. Additionally, I have experience with C and C++ and also working with various Cloud and CDN providers to enhance client-server integration.

🌐 As a Full Stack Developer, I design and develop websites, utilizing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies to create fully functional and user-friendly online platforms. I'am familiar with Wordpress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and also working with databases like mysql, mongodb, sqlserver and more with focus on security with Cloud and CDN integration.
