### Hello there! 👋 My name is Kaveh Karpour Safaei,
 
I am a dedicated software engineer with almost four years of professional experience. I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects that help uplift people, and building a thriving community of developers.

#### Due to my involvement in various projects and my eagerness to learn new skills, I have been busy and have not had the opportunity to publish much code on GitHub. However, I am striving to become more active on the platform.

💻 My areas of expertise include Python, JavaScript, and Web development with WordPress, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery. Additionally, I have experience with C and C++ and also working with various Cloud and CDN providers to enhance client-server integration.

🎮 Game development is an essential passion of mine, and I take it very seriously. As a programmer, I have worked on various personal and corporate projects, which I would recommend exploring in further detail through the link below. While game development may be a hobby, it is much more than just a leisurely activity for me.

🔭 Currently, I am employed as a software engineer, and I am always eager to learn new technologies, especially in the realm of AI and Machine Learning.

#### 📫 If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to send me a direct message through my Email or LinkedIn.
